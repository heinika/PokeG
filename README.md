It's fork from [Pokedex](https://github.com/skydoves/Pokedex),I create PokeG becase of Pokedex pokemon's status is radom data.

I want to use PokeG to simple glance pokemon's status with happy mood.

I use view to replace activity which make page switch more smooth.

Data binding replace by view binding.(I hate it!)
